### Summary of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Initial Value Problems

In the realm of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the concept of initial value problems extends from Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in dimension 1. In the case of PDEs, which operate in higher dimensions, we encounter initial conditions and boundary conditions. 

#### Initial Conditions
When the PDE problem involves time dependency, initial conditions are crucial. These conditions focus on determining the state of the system at specific time points, such as at t=0 or t=t0.

#### Boundary Conditions
Boundary conditions, on the other hand, define the behavior of the PDE on the boundary of the system. This could involve specifying the values of the unknown variable on the boundary.

In essence, while initial conditions mark the starting point for the system, boundary conditions ensure the PDE accurately models the evolution of the system within its defined boundaries.
