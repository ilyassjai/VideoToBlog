### Heat Equation Description

In section 3.1 of this chapter, we delve into the heat equation, a fundamental concept in understanding temperature dynamics within a room. The equation takes the form:

```
∂U/∂t - ∇^2U = F
```

Here, `F` represents the heat source, and `U` denotes the temperature. By solving this equation, we aim to determine the temperature distribution in the room over time.

### Boundary Conditions

#### Dirichlet Boundary Condition

A Dirichlet boundary condition involves prescribing the temperature (`u = g`) on the boundary (`OQ`) of the room. This condition allows us to establish the initial temperature distribution.

#### Homogeneous Dirichlet Boundary Condition

In contrast, a Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition is characterized by `u = 0` on `OQ`. This condition sets the temperature to zero on the boundary, offering a different perspective on temperature analysis.

### Elliptic Partial Differential Equation

The equation `-∆u(x) = f(x)` with `u|∂Ω = 0` represents an elliptic PDE with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. This formulation plays a crucial role in exploring temperature dynamics within a defined space.

By understanding and applying these boundary conditions, we can effectively model and analyze temperature variations in a given environment.
