10.29,19.61," In this video, we will discuss the well-posedness of PDEs, or actually PDEs plus a set of conditions.",-0.16
20.31,28.85," The situation already occurred in dimension 1 with ODEs, where we had the ODE plus the",-0.16
28.85,31.97," initial condition, and that was called the initial value problem.",-0.16
32.21,33.57, That's what we did in chapter 1.,-0.16
33.57,41.31," Now, in a case of a PDE, so higher dimensions, we're going to have initial condition and",-0.13
41.31,42.43, boundary conditions.,-0.13
42.77,47.65," Actually, we're going to have initial conditions if the problem depends on time.",-0.13
47.99,54.75," In this case, we will be interested in the value at time t equals 0, or t times equals",-0.13
54.75,55.25, t0.,-0.13
55.47,61.21," But we want to have the value of the system, the state of the system at some point, and",-0.13
61.21,63.21, then the PDE will actually...,-0.13
63.57,69.27," model the evolution of the system, but somehow we need to know where we start.",-0.15
69.93,77.01," We also have the boundary condition, which is an equation that will be satisfied on the",-0.15
77.01,82.57," boundary, possibly the value of the unknown on the boundary.",-0.15
83.27,86.19, So it's pretty clear what we have for initial condition.,-0.15
86.19,91.23," Basically, the value of the unknown at t equals 0.",-0.15
91.73,93.19, I just would like to explain.,-0.15
93.57,96.63, a little bit more what we have for boundary condition.,-0.26
96.63,103.33," So let's consider a regular open set omega included in Rd, which is of class C1.",-0.26
103.89,110.67," And let us consider a differential operator A, and the PDE au equals f, where f is the",-0.26
110.67,112.71, data and u is the unknown.,-0.26
113.29,120.33," Then, by definition, the boundary condition is an equation that you must satisfy on the",-0.26
120.33,122.37, boundary or part of the boundary.,-0.26
123.57,128.55," You can have the Dirichlet boundary condition, which is probably a very simple boundary",-0.18
128.55,130.47," condition, a very simple equation to satisfy.",-0.18
130.75,136.95, It's u equals g on the boundary or part of the boundary for a given g.,-0.18
137.37,141.63, So that's you prescribe the value of u on the boundary.,-0.18
142.77,146.07, And possibly the value you prescribe is 0.,-0.18
146.07,150.93," In this case, we have what we call a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.",-0.18
151.73,152.67, Let me give you an example.,-0.18
153.57,161.35," Basically, minus Laplace u equals f, and you prescribed u to be equal to 0 on the boundary.",-0.18
161.49,164.81, That is an elliptic PDE with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.,-0.18
165.69,167.11, It can represent many things.,-0.18
167.65,173.33," For instance, if you are in mechanics, then the boundary condition u equals 0, u equals",-0.18
173.33,182.25, g means that you are basically attaching whatever you're modeling.,-0.18
183.57,184.19, On the boundary.,-0.2
184.41,185.99, So it's really an attachment condition.,-0.2
186.87,188.17, You prescribe the value.,-0.2
188.37,193.05," So if it's displacement, displacement is equal to 0, you know what is displacement on the",-0.2
193.05,193.25, boundary.,-0.2
193.59,194.41, That's an example.,-0.2
195.47,200.57," You can also have here a parabolic PDE, and then you can see that we're going to have",-0.2
200.57,203.43, both an initial condition and a boundary condition.,-0.2
203.59,211.53, So here is what is the heat equation that we will actually describe in section 3.1,-0.2
211.53,212.27, of this chapter.,-0.2
212.27,217.99," So it's time derivative of u minus Laplace operator equals f, and I can already tell",-0.11
217.99,223.29," you that f will be the source of heat, and u is the temperature.",-0.11
223.93,228.03, And so you're basically trying to figure out what is going to be the temperature in,-0.11
228.03,228.29, the room.,-0.11
228.45,234.01," So obviously, if you have the Dirichlet boundary condition, it means that you impose, you",-0.11
234.01,241.99," prescribe the temperature on the boundary of your room, and you are interested in also",-0.11
241.99,242.25, knowing what the temperature is.,-0.11
242.25,245.59," Knowing what is the temperature when you start the experiment, when you start observing.",-0.14
245.71,249.15," Obviously, if you start with a room which is really cold, it's going to be different",-0.14
249.15,251.05, as if you start with a room which is very hot.,-0.14
251.13,252.61, So it makes perfectly good sense.,-0.14
253.19,257.37, That will be a parabolic PDE with homogenous Dirichlet boundary condition and a given,-0.14
257.37,258.15, initial condition.,-0.14
258.87,261.19," Now, I can just rewrite this way.",-0.14
261.33,267.25, It's just easier by just writing Tx equals 0 and then actually writing the sets this way.,-0.14
268.15,268.47, All right.,-0.14
269.41,271.55, We can also have Newman boundary conditions.,-0.14
271.55,276.85," And that means that we have the normal derivative of u, which is equal to g on the boundary.",-0.16
277.51,283.01, And homogenous Newman boundary condition means that g is equal to 0.,-0.16
283.47,284.53, Here is an example.,-0.16
285.31,291.13," Minus Laplace u equals f, and du over dn equals 0.",-0.16
291.61,297.67," Well, say, for instance, that basically we're not at equilibrium in terms of heat.",-0.16
298.11,301.45," And then what you are looking at is, well, obviously,",-0.16
301.55,303.59, you still have a source in your room.,-0.11
304.07,312.01," But instead of prescribing a value of your temperature on the boundary,",-0.11
312.37,318.35," what you're actually saying is, what if the flux of heat going out or not going out?",-0.11
318.41,319.45," I mean, here is 0.",-0.11
319.63,324.93," So obviously, you're saying, OK, well, it's a very good house here that you have.",-0.11
324.93,331.53," But in any case, what we're doing here is basically talking about another type,",-0.11
331.55,332.97, another type of boundary condition.,-0.23
333.19,335.65, So we have different types of boundary conditions.,-0.23
336.17,338.01, We can also mix the boundary conditions.,-0.23
338.57,342.51, And let me now tell you what is well-posedness.,-0.23
342.81,347.41," So if it's something that will be discussed in dimension one for ODEs,",-0.23
347.67,350.71, let me tell you what it is in the setting of PDEs.,-0.23
350.97,352.71, Then e and f are two spaces.,-0.23
353.37,356.39," f is, small f is in capital F.",-0.23
356.47,357.17, That will be the data.,-0.23
357.51,361.53, And a is your differential operator coming from e.,-0.23
361.55,370.97," And what we are doing is we are looking for solutions in e to the equation au equals f,",-0.28
371.09,372.25, which is the PDE.,-0.28
373.01,377.31, And you obviously have conditions as well.,-0.28
377.93,380.63," So boundary conditions, central condition, you name it.",-0.28
380.99,388.25," OK, so the PDE will be well-posed in the sense of Atomor if three things occur.",-0.28
388.59,390.33," Number one, the solution exists.",-0.28
390.83,391.33, Number two.,-0.28
391.55,393.49," Number two, the solution is unique.",-0.13
394.29,400.13," Number three, the solution u changes continuously with respect to f.",-0.13
400.25,408.07," If that is the case, then the PDE with its conditions will be called well-posed in the sense of Atomor.",-0.13
408.51,414.93, And you know already about well-posedness because we talked about it in dimension one where we have ODE.,-0.13
415.37,418.79, It's basically the same definition extended to PDEs.,-0.13
418.79,420.79, And whenever the...,-0.13
421.55,426.67," If the PDE is not well-posed, then it will be called ill-posed.",-0.22
