 In this video, we will discuss the well-posedness of PDEs, or actually PDEs plus a set of conditions.  The situation already occurred in dimension 1 with ODEs, where we had the ODE plus the initial condition,  and that was called the initial value problem. That's what we did in chapter 1.  Now, in a case of a PDE, so higher dimensions, we're going to have initial condition and boundary conditions.  Actually, we're going to have initial conditions if the problem depends on time.  In this case, we will be interested in the value at time t equals 0, or t times equals t0.  But we want to have the value of the system, the state of the system, at some point,  and then the PDE will actually...  model the evolution of the system, but somehow we need to know where we start.  We also have the boundary condition, which is an equation that will be satisfied on the boundary,  possibly the value of the unknown on the boundary.  So it's pretty clear what we have for initial condition.  Basically, the value of the unknown at t equals 0.  I just would like to explain...  a little bit more what we have for boundary condition.  So let's consider a regular open set, omega, included in ODE, which is of class C1.  And let us consider a differential operator, A, and the PDE, AU equals F,  where F is the data and U is the unknown.  Then, by definition, the boundary condition is an equation that you must satisfy on the boundary,  or part of the boundary.  You can have the Dirichlet boundary condition, which is probably a very simple boundary condition,  a very simple equation to satisfy.  It's U equals G on the boundary, or part of the boundary, for a given G.  So that's... you prescribe the value of U on the boundary.  And possibly, the value you prescribe is 0.  In this case, we have what we call a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.  Let me give you an example.  So basically, minus the Laplace U equals F,  and you prescribed U to be equal to 0 on the boundary.  That is an elliptic PDE with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.  It can represent many things.  For instance, if you are in mechanics, then the boundary condition U equals 0, U equals G,  means that you are basically attaching your... whatever you're modeling,  on the boundary, so it's really an attachment condition.  You prescribe the value, so if it's displacement, displacement is equal to 0,  you know what is displacement on the boundary.  That's an example.  You can also have here a parabolic PDE,  and then you can see that we're going to have both an initial condition and a boundary condition.  So here is what is the heat equation that we will actually describe in section 3.1 of this chapter.  So it's time, Dirichlet of U minus Laplace operator equals F,  and it can already tell you that F will be the source of heat, and U is temperature.  And so you're basically trying to figure out what is going to be the temperature in the room.  So obviously, if you have the Dirichlet boundary condition,  it means that you impose, you prescribe the temperature on the boundary of your room,  and you are interested in also knowing what is the temperature,  and you are interested in also knowing what is the temperature,  the temperature when you start the experiment, when you start observing. Obviously, if you start  with a room which is really cold, it's going to be different than if you start with a room which  is very hot. So it makes perfectly good sense. That will be a parabolic PDE with homogenous  directly binary condition and a given initial condition. Now, I can just rewrite this way.  It's just easier by just writing Tx equals zero and then actually writing the sets this way.  All right. We can also have Newman binary conditions. And that means that we have the  normal derivative of U, which is equal to G on the boundary. And homogenous Newman  binary condition means that G is equal to zero. Here is an example. Minus Laplace U  equals F. And Du over Dn equals zero. Well, say, for instance, that basically we're not  at equilibrium in terms of Tx. We're not at equilibrium in terms of Tx. We're not  at equilibrium in terms of Tx. We're not at equilibrium in terms of Tx. We're not  at equilibrium in terms of heat. And then what you are looking at is, well, obviously,  you still have a source in your room. But instead of prescribing a value of your temperature  on the boundary, what you're actually saying is, what if the flux of heat going out or  not going out? I mean, here is zero. So obviously, you're saying, OK, well, it's a very good  house here that you have. But in any case, what we're doing here is we're going to  doing here is basically talking about another type of boundary condition. So we have different  types of boundary conditions. We can also mix the boundary conditions. And let me now tell you what  is well-posedness. So it's something that will be discussed in dimension one for ODEs. Let me  tell you what it is in the setting of PDEs. Then E and F are two spaces. F is, small f is in capital  F, that will be the data. And A is your differential operator coming from E to F. And what we are doing  is we are looking for solutions in E. So to the equation AU equals F, which is the PDE.  Okay. And you obviously have conditions as well. So boundary conditions, central condition,  you name it. Okay. So the PDE will be a well-posed, in the sense of Atomor,  if three things occur. Number one, the solution exists. Number two, the solution is unique.  Number three, the solution U changes continuously with respect to F. If that is the case,  then the PDE, with its conditions, will be called well-posed, in the sense of Atomor.  And you know already about well-posedness because we talked about it in dimension one,  where we have ODE. It's basically,  the same definition extended to PDEs. And whenever the PDE is not well-posed,  then it will be called ill-posed.
