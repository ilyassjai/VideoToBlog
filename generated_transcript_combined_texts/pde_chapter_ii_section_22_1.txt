 In this video, we will discuss the well-posedness of PDEs, or actually PDEs plus a set of conditions.  The situation already occurred in dimension 1 with ODEs, where we had the ODE plus the  initial condition, and that was called the initial value problem.  That's what we did in chapter 1.  Now, in a case of a PDE, so higher dimensions, we're going to have initial condition and  boundary conditions.  Actually, we're going to have initial conditions if the problem depends on time.  In this case, we will be interested in the value at time t equals 0, or t times equals  t0.  But we want to have the value of the system, the state of the system at some point, and  then the PDE will actually...  model the evolution of the system, but somehow we need to know where we start.  We also have the boundary condition, which is an equation that will be satisfied on the  boundary, possibly the value of the unknown on the boundary.  So it's pretty clear what we have for initial condition.  Basically, the value of the unknown at t equals 0.  I just would like to explain.  a little bit more what we have for boundary condition.  So let's consider a regular open set omega included in Rd, which is of class C1.  And let us consider a differential operator A, and the PDE au equals f, where f is the  data and u is the unknown.  Then, by definition, the boundary condition is an equation that you must satisfy on the  boundary or part of the boundary.  You can have the Dirichlet boundary condition, which is probably a very simple boundary  condition, a very simple equation to satisfy.  It's u equals g on the boundary or part of the boundary for a given g.  So that's you prescribe the value of u on the boundary.  And possibly the value you prescribe is 0.  In this case, we have what we call a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.  Let me give you an example.  Basically, minus Laplace u equals f, and you prescribed u to be equal to 0 on the boundary.  That is an elliptic PDE with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.  It can represent many things.  For instance, if you are in mechanics, then the boundary condition u equals 0, u equals  g means that you are basically attaching whatever you're modeling.  On the boundary.  So it's really an attachment condition.  You prescribe the value.  So if it's displacement, displacement is equal to 0, you know what is displacement on the  boundary.  That's an example.  You can also have here a parabolic PDE, and then you can see that we're going to have  both an initial condition and a boundary condition.  So here is what is the heat equation that we will actually describe in section 3.1  of this chapter.  So it's time derivative of u minus Laplace operator equals f, and I can already tell  you that f will be the source of heat, and u is the temperature.  And so you're basically trying to figure out what is going to be the temperature in  the room.  So obviously, if you have the Dirichlet boundary condition, it means that you impose, you  prescribe the temperature on the boundary of your room, and you are interested in also  knowing what the temperature is.  Knowing what is the temperature when you start the experiment, when you start observing.  Obviously, if you start with a room which is really cold, it's going to be different  as if you start with a room which is very hot.  So it makes perfectly good sense.  That will be a parabolic PDE with homogenous Dirichlet boundary condition and a given  initial condition.  Now, I can just rewrite this way.  It's just easier by just writing Tx equals 0 and then actually writing the sets this way.  All right.  We can also have Newman boundary conditions.  And that means that we have the normal derivative of u, which is equal to g on the boundary.  And homogenous Newman boundary condition means that g is equal to 0.  Here is an example.  Minus Laplace u equals f, and du over dn equals 0.  Well, say, for instance, that basically we're not at equilibrium in terms of heat.  And then what you are looking at is, well, obviously,  you still have a source in your room.  But instead of prescribing a value of your temperature on the boundary,  what you're actually saying is, what if the flux of heat going out or not going out?  I mean, here is 0.  So obviously, you're saying, OK, well, it's a very good house here that you have.  But in any case, what we're doing here is basically talking about another type,  another type of boundary condition.  So we have different types of boundary conditions.  We can also mix the boundary conditions.  And let me now tell you what is well-posedness.  So if it's something that will be discussed in dimension one for ODEs,  let me tell you what it is in the setting of PDEs.  Then e and f are two spaces.  f is, small f is in capital F.  That will be the data.  And a is your differential operator coming from e.  And what we are doing is we are looking for solutions in e to the equation au equals f,  which is the PDE.  And you obviously have conditions as well.  So boundary conditions, central condition, you name it.  OK, so the PDE will be well-posed in the sense of Atomor if three things occur.  Number one, the solution exists.  Number two.  Number two, the solution is unique.  Number three, the solution u changes continuously with respect to f.  If that is the case, then the PDE with its conditions will be called well-posed in the sense of Atomor.  And you know already about well-posedness because we talked about it in dimension one where we have ODE.  It's basically the same definition extended to PDEs.  And whenever the...  If the PDE is not well-posed, then it will be called ill-posed.
