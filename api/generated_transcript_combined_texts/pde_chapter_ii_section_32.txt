 As a byproduct from the previous video, we have what is called the transport equation,  which can be used to model transport, transport of pollutants, for instance.  Let us consider this equation, the transport equation, where C is a constant.  Basically, it will have something to do with the speed, the velocity of the transport.  And F is a given function.  Then U can be the density of pollutants in the air.  That is a transport equation used to model this phenomenon.  You can also use the transport equation to model traffic flow, especially in 1D.  If you have, for instance, a highway, then you will have an interest in knowing what is the density of cars on the highway.  And of course, the higher the density, the lower the velocity of the car on that part of the highway.  Now, we're saying...  I'm saying in 1D because it's obviously a highway.  I mean, it can be considered as a one-dimensional mathematical object.  But you see that we are dealing with a 2D PDE because you have 1D in space, but 1D in time.  Obviously, that traffic will evolve with time.  So that is an equation that can be used to model traffic flow.  Now, I would like to use these examples to show you...  Something called characteristics.  And we will not get in a lot of details in this class.  Next year, if you choose the appropriate elective classes, then you will get more in details for this method  and see how it can actually be used for a lot of things.  And it's actually a very interesting thing to actually get to understand.  But we'll just explain things very quickly.  Very quickly.  So what we are trying to do is to find a function, capital X, such that the function T gives U of T, capital X of T, is constant.  And requiring this is obviously requiring that D, the derivative of W with respect to time, is 0.  So let me write this time derivative of W with respect...  That's simply a chain rule.  That's the time derivative of U, plus dx over dt space derivative of U.  Okay.  And again, if we want dx over dt to be a constant, then it means that dw over dt has to be equal to 0.  Right?  So because W is constant.  So what we're saying then is that X of S will be Cs plus X of 0.  Which means that...  U T X of T is equal to U0 X of 0.  So you see what happens.  We have the solution, right?  U T X of T will be somewhat what happens at the initial condition at X0.  But you see, you're basically following some kind of a path here.  And this is called the characteristic method.  And we are dealing here with characteristics.  So again, this is something that you will get in much more detail.  Next year, should you choose to select the elective classes that will actually go more in depth with these PDs.
